! File with "overrides" for Baltic_OM4_025, relative to OM4_025

! This must ONLY be used in the ice-ocean mode, NOT fully coupled mode.
ADD_DIURNAL_SW = True           !   [Boolean] default = False
                                ! If true, add a synthetic diurnal cycle to the shortwave radiation.

! These overrrides would allow the use of a SIS_input file for OM4_025
#override REENTRANT_X = False   !   [Boolean] default = True
                                ! If true, the domain is zonally reentrant.
#override TRIPOLAR_N = False    !   [Boolean] default = False
                                ! Use tripolar connectivity at the northern edge of the domain.  With
                                ! TRIPOLAR_N, NIGLOBAL must be even.

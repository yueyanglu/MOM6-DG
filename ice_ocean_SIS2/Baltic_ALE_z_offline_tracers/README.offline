----
QUICK-START
----
1) Follow instructions to compile MOM6 executables using ice_ocean_SIS2 and ocean_only drivers
2) Link executables to Baltic_ALE_z directory (replace 'intel' and 'repro' as necessary)
  ln -s ../../build/intel/ice_ocean_SIS2/repro/MOM6 ./MOM6_coupled
  ln -s ../../build/intel/ice_ocean_SIS2/repro/MOM6 ./MOM6_ocean_only
3) Run model forward using the provided script to generate necessary fields
  source run_online.sh
4) Run model offline
  source run_offline.sh

OVERVIEW
----
'Offline tracer modeling' uses physical fields (e.g. mass transports and layer thicknesses) saved
from a previous integration of the physical model to transport passive tracers. These fields are
accumulated or averaged over a period of time (in this test case, 1 day) and used to integrate 
portions of the MOM6 code base that handle the 3d advection and diffusion of passive tracers.
This capability has currently targeted the Baltic_ALE_z test case, though some work has also been
done with the OM4 1/2 degree configuration. Work is ongoing to develop recommendations and best
practices for investigators seeking to use MOM6 for offline tracer modeling.

The subroutine step_tracers that coordinates this can be found in MOM.F90 and is only called
using the solo ocean driver. This is to avoid issues with coupling to other climate components
that may be relying on fluxes from the ocean to be coupled more often than the offline time step.
Other routines related to offline tracer modeling can be found in tracers/MOM_offline_control.F90

As can also be seen in the comments for the step_tracers subroutine, an offline time step 
comprises the following steps
      1)  Using the layer thicknesses and tracer concentrations from the previous timestep, 
          half of the accumulated vertical mixing (eatr and ebtr) is applied in the call to 
          tracer_column_fns.
          For tracers whose source/sink terms need dt, this value is set to 1/2 dt_offline
      2)  Half of the accumulated surface freshwater fluxes are applied
      START ITERATION
      3)  Accumulated mass fluxes are used to do horizontal transport. The number of iterations 
          used in advect_tracer is limited to 2 (e.g x->y->x->y). The remaining mass fluxes are
          stored for later use and resulting layer thicknesses fed into the next step
      4)  Tracers and the h-grid are regridded and remapped in a call to ALE. This allows for
          layers which might 'vanish' because of horizontal mass transport to be 'reinflated'
          and essentially allows for the vertical transport of tracers
      5)  Check that transport is done if the remaining mass fluxes equals 0 or if the max 
          number of iterations has been reached
      END ITERATION
      6)  Repeat steps 1 and 2
      7)  Force a remapping to the stored layer thicknesses that correspond to the snapshot of
          the online model at the end of an accumulation interval
      8)  Reset T/S and h to their stored snapshotted values to prevent model drift

----
EVALUATING
----
A framework for formally regression testing the offline capability still needs to be developed.
However, as a simple way of testing whether the offline model is nominally behaving as expected,
the total inventory of the advection test tracers (tr1, tr2, etc.) should be conserved between
time steps except for the last 4 decimal places.

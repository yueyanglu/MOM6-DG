/*! \page Internal_Vert_Mixing Internal Vertical Mixing

Sets the interior vertical diffusion of scalars due to the following processes:

-# Shear-driven mixing (\ref section_Shear): \cite jackson2008 or KPP interior;
-# Background mixing (\ref section_Background): via CVMix (Bryan-Lewis profile),
   the scheme described by \cite harrison2008, or that in \cite danabasoglu2012.
-# Double-diffusion (\ref section_Double_Diff): old method or new method via CVMix;
-# Tidal mixing: many options available, see \ref section_Internal_Tidal_Mixing.

In addition, the MOM_set_diffusivity has the option to set the interior vertical
viscosity associated with processes 1,2 and 4 listed above, which is stored in
visc\%Kv\_slow. Vertical viscosity due to shear-driven mixing is passed via
visc\%Kv\_shear

The resulting diffusivity, \f$K_d\f$, is the sum of all the contributions
unless you set BBL_MIXING_AS_MAX to True, in which case the maximum of
all the contributions is used.

In addition, \f$K_d\f$ is multiplied by the term:

\f[
   \frac{N^2}{N^2 + \Omega^2}
\f]

where \f$N\f$ is the buoyancy frequency and \f$\Omega\f$ is the angular velocity
of the Earth. This allows the buoyancy fluxes to tend to zero in regions
of very weak stratification, allowing a no-flux bottom boundary condition
to be satisfied.

\section section_Shear Shear-driven Mixing

Below the surface mixed layer, there are places in the world's oceans
where shear mixing is known to take place. This shear-driven mixing can
be represented in MOM6 through either CVMix or the parameterization of
\cite jackson2008.

\subsection subsection_CVMix_shear Shear-driven mixing in CVMix

The community vertical mixing (CVMix) code contains options for shear
mixing from either \cite large1994 or from \cite pacanowski1981. In MOM6,
CVMix is included via a git submodule which loads the external CVMix
package. The shear mixing routine in CVMix was developed to reproduce the
observed mixing of the equatorial undercurrent in the Pacific.

We first compute the gradient Richardson number \f$\mbox{Ri} = N^2 / S^2\f$,
where \f$S\f$ is the vertical shear (\f$S = ||\bf{u}_z ||\f$) and \f$N\f$
is the buoyancy frequency (\f$N^2 = -g \rho_z / \rho_0\f$). The
parameterization of \cite large1994 is as follows, where the diffusivity \f$\kappa\f$
is given by

\f[
   \kappa = \kappa_0 \left[ 1 - \min \left( 1, \frac{\mbox{Ri}}{\mbox{Ri}_c} \right)
   ^2 \right] ^3 ,
\f]

with \f$\kappa_0 = 5 \times 10^{-3}\, \mbox{m}^2 \,\mbox{s}^{-1}\f$ and \f$\mbox{Ri}_c = 0.7\f$.

One can instead select the \cite pacanowski1981 scheme within CVMix. Unlike
the \cite large1994 scheme, they propose that the vertical shear
viscosity \f$\nu_{\mbox{shear}}\f$ be different from the vertical shear
diffusivity \f$\kappa_{\mbox{shear}}\f$. For gravitationally stable
profiles (i.e., \f$N^2 > 0\f$), they chose

\f[
   \nu_{\mbox{shear}} = \frac{\nu_0}{(1 + a \mbox{Ri})^n}
\f]

\f[
   \kappa_{\mbox{shear}} = \frac{\nu_0}{(1 + a \mbox{Ri})^{n+1}}
\f]

where \f$\nu_0\f$, \f$a\f$ and \f$n\f$ are adjustable parameters. Common settings are \f$a = 5\f$
and \f$n = 2\f$.

For both CVMix shear mixing schemes, the mixing coefficients are set to
a large value for gravitationally unstable profiles.

\subsection subsection_kappa_shear Shear-driven mixing in Jackson

While the above parameterization works well enough in the equatorial
Pacific, another place one can expect shear-mixing to matter is
in overflows of dense water. \cite jackson2008 proposes a new shear
parameterization with the goal of working in both the equatorial undercurrent
and for overflows, also to have smooth transitions between unstable and
stable regions. Their scheme looks like:

\f{eqnarray}
   \frac{\partial^2 \kappa}{\partial z^2} - \frac{\kappa}{L^2_d} &= - 2 SF(\mbox{Ri}) .
   \label{eq:Jackson_10}
\f}

This is similar to the locally constant stratification limit of
\cite turner1986, but with the addition of a decay length scale
\f$L_d = \lambda L_b\f$. Here \f$L_b = Q^{1/2} / N\f$ is the buoyancy
length scale where \f$Q\f$ is the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) per
unit mass, and \f$\lambda\f$ is a nondimensional constant.  The function
\f$F(\mbox{Ri})\f$ is a function of the Richardson number that remains
to be determined. As in \cite turner1986, there must be a critical
value of \f$\mbox{Ri}\f$ above which \f$F(\mbox{Ri}) = 0\f$.
For better agreement with observations in a law-of-the-wall configuration,
we modify \f$L_d\f$ to be \f$\min (\lambda L_b, L_z)\f$, where \f$L_z\f$
is the distance to the nearest solid boundary. This can be understood by
considering \f$L_d\f$ to be the size of the largest turbulent eddies,
whether they are constrained by the stratification (through \f$L_b\f$)
or through the geometry (through \f$L_z\f$).

There are two length scales: the width of the low Richardson number region
as in \cite turner1986, and the buoyancy length scale, which is the
length scale over which the TKE is affected by the stratification (see
\cite jackson2008 for more details). In particular, the inclusion of a
decay length scale means that the diffusivity decays exponentially away
from the mixing region with a length scale of \f$L_d\f$. This is important
since turbulent eddies generated in the low \f$\mbox{Ri}\f$ layer can
be vertically self-advected and mix nearby regions. This method yields
a smoother diffusivity than that in \cite hallberg2000, especially in
areas where the Richardson number is noisy.

This parameterization predicts the turbulent eddy diffusivity in terms
of the vertical profiles of velocity and density, providing that the
TKE is known. To complete the parameterization we use a TKE \f$Q\f$
budget such as that used in second-order turbulence closure models
(\cite umlauf2005). We make a few additional assumptions, however,
and use the simplified form

\f{eqnarray}
   \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left[ (\kappa + \nu_0) \frac{\partial Q}
   {\partial z} \right] + \kappa (S^2 - N^2) - Q(c_N N + c_S S) &= 0.
   \label{eq:Jackson_11}
\f}

The system is therefore in balance between a vertical diffusion of
TKE caused by both the eddy and molecular viscosity \f$(\nu_0)\f$,
the production of TKE by shear, a sink due to stratification, and the
dissipation. Note that we are assuming a Prandtl number of 1, although a
parameterization for the Prandtl number could be added. We have assumed
that the TKE reaches a quasi-steady state faster than the flow is evolving
and faster than it can be affected by mean-flow advection so that \f$DQ/Dt =
0\f$. Since this parameterization is meant to be used in climate models
with low horizontal resolution and large time steps compared to the
mixing time scales, this is a reasonable assumption. The most tenuous
assumption is in the form of the dissipation \f$\epsilon = Q(C_N N +
c_S S)\f$ (where \f$c_N\f$ and \f$c_S\f$ are to be determined),
which is assumed to be dependent on the buoyancy frequency (through loss
of energy to internal waves) and the velocity shear (through the energy
cascade to smaller scales).

We can rewrite \eqref{eq:Jackson_10} as the steady "transport" equation
for the turbulent diffusivity (i.e., with \f$D\kappa/Dt = 0\f$),

\f[
  \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \left( \kappa \frac{\partial \kappa}{\partial z}
  \right) + 2\kappa SF(\mbox{Ri}) - \left( \frac{\kappa}{L_d} \right)^2 -
  \left( \frac{\partial \kappa}{\partial z} \right) ^2 = 0 .
\f]

The first term on the left can be regarded as a vertical transport of
diffusivity, the second term as a source, and the final two as sinks.
This equation with \eqref{eq:Jackson_11} are simple enough to solve quickly
using an iterative technique.

We also need boundary conditions for \eqref{eq:Jackson_10}
and \eqref{eq:Jackson_11}. For the turbulent diffusivity we use
\f$\kappa = 0\f$ since our diffusivity is numerically defined on
layer interfaces. This ensures that there is no turbulent flux across
boundaries. For the TKE we use boundary conditions of \f$Q = Q_0\f$ where
\f$Q_0\f$ is a constant value of TKE, used to prevent a singularity
in \eqref{eq:Jackson_10}, that is chosen to be small enough to not
influence results. Note that the value of \f$\kappa\f$ calculated here
reflects shear-driven turbulent mixing only; the total diffusivity would
be this value plus any diffusivities due to other turbulent processes
or a background value.

Based on \cite turner1986, we choose \f$F(\mbox{Ri})\f$ of the form

\f[
   F(\mbox{Ri}) = F_0 \left( \frac{1 - \mbox{Ri} / \mbox{Ri}_c}
   {1 + \alpha \mbox{Ri} / \mbox{Ri}_c} \right) ,
\f]

where \f$\alpha\f$ is the curvature parameter. This table shows the default
values of the relevant parameters:

<table>

These can all be adjusted at run time, plus some other parameters such as the maximum number of iterations
to perform.

\section section_Background Background Mixing

There are three choices for the vertical background mixing: that in
CVMix (\cite bryan1979), that in \cite harrison2008, and that in
\cite danabasoglu2012.

\subsection subsection_bryan_lewis CVMix background mixing

The background vertical mixing in \cite bryan1979 is of the form:

\f[
   \kappa = C_1 + C_2 \mbox{atan} [ C_3 ( |z| - C_4 )]
\f]

where the constants are runtime parameters as shown here:

<table>
<caption id="bryan_lewis_parms">Bryan Lewis parameters</caption>

</table>

\subsection subsection_henyey Henyey IGW background mixing

\cite harrison2008 choose a vertical background mixing with a latitudinal
dependence based on \cite henyey1986. Specifically, theory predicts
a minimum in mixing due to wave-wave interactions at the equator and
observations support that theory. In this option, the surface background
diffusivity is

\f[
   \kappa_s (\phi) = \max \left[ 10^{-7}, \kappa_0 \left| \frac{f}{f_{30}} \right|
   \frac{ \cosh^{-1} (1/f) }{ \cosh^{-1} (1/f_{30})} \right] ,
\f]

where \f$f_{30}\f$ is the Coriolis frequency at \f$30^\circ\f$ latitude. The two-dimensional equation for
the diffusivity is

\f[
   \kappa(\phi, z) = \kappa_s + \Gamma \mbox{atan} \left( \frac{H_t}{\delta_t} \right) +
   \Gamma \mbox{atan} \left( \frac{z - H_t}{\delta_t} \right) ,
\f]
\f[
   \Gamma = \frac{(\kappa_d - \kappa_s) }{\left[ 0.5 \pi + \mbox{atan} \left( \frac{H_t}{\delta_t} \right)
   \right] },
\f]

where \f$H_t = 2500\, \mbox{m}\f$, \f$\delta_t = 222\, \mbox{m}\f$, and
\f$\kappa_d\f$ is the deep ocean diffusivity of \f$10^{-4}\, \mbox{m}^2
\, \mbox{s}^{-1}\f$. Note that this is the vertical structure described
in \cite harrison2008, but that isn't what is in the MOM6 code. Instead, the surface
value is propagated down, with the assumption that the tidal mixing parameterization
will provide the deep mixing: \ref section_Internal_Tidal_Mixing.

There is also a "new" Henyey version, taking into account the effect of stratification on
TKE dissipation,

\todo Harrison (personal communication) recommends that this option be made obsolete and
eventually removed.

\f[
   \epsilon = \epsilon_0 \frac{f}{f_0} \frac{\mbox{acosh} (N/f)}{\mbox{acosh} (N_0 / f_0)}
\f]

where \f$N_0\f$ and \f$f_0\f$ are the reference buoyancy frequency and inertial frequencies, respectively
and \f$\epsilon_0\f$ is the reference dissipation at \f$(N_0, f_0)\f$. In the previous version, \f$N =
N_0\f$. Additionally, the relationship between diapycnal diffusivities and stratification is included:

\f[
   \kappa = \frac{\epsilon}{N^2}
\f]
This approach assumes that work done against gravity is uniformly distributed throughout the water column.
The original version concentrates buoyancy work in regions of strong stratification.

\subsection subsection_danabasoglu_back Danabasoglu background mixing

The shape of the \cite danabasoglu2012 background mixing has a uniform background value, with a dip
at the equator and a bump at \f$\pm 30^{\circ}\f$ degrees latitude. The form is shown in this figure

\image html background_varying.png "Form of the vertically uniform background mixing in \cite danabasoglu2012. The values are symmetric about the equator."
\imagelatex{background_varying.png,Form of the vertically uniform background mixing in \cite danabasoglu2012. The values are symmetric about the equator.,\includegraphics[width=\textwidth\,height=\textheight/2\,keepaspectratio=true]}

Some parameters of this curve are set in the input file, some are hard-coded in calculate_bkgnd_mixing.

\section section_Double_Diff Double Diffusion

From \cite large1994, \cite griffies2015a, double-diffusive mixing
can occur when the vertical gradient of density is stable but the
vertical gradient of either salinity or temperature is unstable in its
contribution to density. The key stratification parameter for double
diffusive processes is

\f[
   R_\rho = \frac{\alpha}{\beta} \left( \frac{\partial \Theta / \partial z}{\partial S /
   \partial z} \right) ,
\f]

where the thermal expansion coefficient is given by

\f[
   \alpha = - \frac{1}{\rho} \left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial \Theta} \right) ,
\f]

and the haline contraction coefficient is

\f[
   \beta = \frac{1}{\rho} \left( \frac{\partial \rho}{\partial S} \right) .
\f]

Note that the effects from double diffusive processes on viscosity are not well known and
are ignored in MOM6.

In MOM6, there are two choices for the implementation of double
diffusion. The older DOUBLE_DIFFUSION option, with reference to an
unknown tech report from NCAR, aims to match the scheme used in MOM4, an update on
\cite large1994. The newer option is to call the routines from CVMix (USE_CVMIX_DDIFF).

There are two regimes of double diffusive processes, salt fingering and diffusive
convective, with differing parameterizations in the two regimes.

\subsection subsection_salt_finger Salt fingering regime

The salt fingering regime occurs when salinity is destabilizing the water column (salty,
above fresh water) and when the stratification parameter \f$R_\rho\f$ is within a
particular range:

\f[
   \frac{\partial S}{\partial z} > 0
\f]
\f[
   1 < R_\rho < R_\rho^0.
\f]

The value of the cutoff \f$R_\rho\f$ is 1.9 in the old code, 2.55 in CVMix.

The form of the diffusivity for both is

\f{eqnarray}{
   \kappa_d =& \kappa_d^0 \left[ 1 - \left( \frac{R_\rho - 1}{R_\rho^0 - 1} \right)
   \right]^3 & \mbox{for } 1 < R_\rho < R_\rho^0 \\
   \kappa_d =& 0 & \mbox{otherwise.}
\f}

The default values of \f$\kappa_d^0\f$ are

\f{eqnarray}{
   \kappa_d^0 =& 1 \times 10^{-4} & \mbox{for salinity and other tracers} \\
   \kappa_d^0 =& 0.7 \times 10^{-4} & \mbox{for temperature.}
\f}

Note that the form in \cite large1994 is slightly different.

\subsection subsection_diffusive_convective Diffusive convective regime

Both implementations of the diffusive convective double diffusion have the same form
(\cite large1994) and are active when

\f[
   \frac{\partial \Theta}{\partial z} < 0
\f]
\f[
   0 < R_\rho < 1.
\f]

For temperature, the vertical diffusivity is given by

\f[
   \kappa_d = \nu_\mbox{molecular} \times 0.909 \exp \left( 4.6 \exp \left[ -.54
   \left( R_\rho^{-1} - 1 \right) \right] \right) ,
\f]

where

\f[
   \nu_\mbox{molecular} = 1.5 \times 10^{-6} \mbox{m}^2 \mbox{s}^{-1}
\f]

is the molecular viscosity of water. Multiplying the diffusivity by the Prandtl number
\f$Pr\f$

\f{eqnarray}{
   Pr = \left\{ \begin{matrix} (1.85 - 0.85 R_\rho^{-1} ) R_\rho & 0.5 \leq R_\rho < 1 \\
   0.15 R_\rho & R_\rho < 0.5 , \end{matrix} \right.
\f}

gives the diffusivity for salinity and other tracers.

\section section_Internal_Tidal_Mixing Internal Tidal Mixing

Two parameterizations of vertical mixing due to internal tides are
available with the option INT_TIDE_DISSIPATION. The first is that of
\cite st_laurent2002 while the second is that of \cite polzin2009. Choose
between them with the INT_TIDE_PROFILE option. There are other relevant
parameters which can be seen in MOM_parameter_doc.all once the main tidal
dissipation switch is turned on.

\subsection subsection_st_laurent St Laurent et al.

The estimated turbulent dissipation rate of
internal tide energy \f$\epsilon\f$ is:

\f[
   \epsilon = \frac{q E(x,y)}{\rho} F(z).
\f]

where \f$\rho\f$ is the reference density of seawater, \f$E(x,y)\f$ is
the energy flux per unit area transferred from barotropic to baroclinic
tides, \f$q\f$ is the fraction of the internal-tide energy dissipated
locally, and \f$F(z)\f$ is the vertical structure of the dissipation.
This \f$q\f$ is estimated to be roughly 0.3 based on observations. The
term \f$E(x,y)\f$ is given by \cite st_laurent2002 as:

\f[
   E(x,y) \simeq \frac{1}{2} \rho N_b \kappa h^2 \langle U^2 \rangle
\f]

where \f$\rho\f$ is the reference density of seawater, \f$N_b\f$ is
the buoyancy frequency along the seafloor, and \f$(\kappa, h)\f$ are
the wavenumber and amplitude scales for the topographic roughness, and
\f$\langle U^2 \rangle\f$ is the barotropic tide variance. It is assumed
that the model will read in topographic roughness squared \f$h^2\f$
from a file (the variable must be named "h2").

To convert from energy dissipation to vertical diffusion \f$K_d\f$,
the simple estimate is:

\f[
   K_d \approx \frac{\Gamma q E(x,y) F(z)}{\rho N^2}
\f]

where \f$\Gamma\f$ is the mixing efficiency, generally set to 0.2
and \f$F(z)\f$ is a vertical structure function with exponential decay
from the bottom:

\f[
   F(z) = \frac{e^{-(H+z)/\zeta}}{\zeta (1 - e^{H/\zeta}}.
\f]

Here, \f$\zeta\f$ is a vertical decay scale with a default of 500 meters.
One change in MOM6 from the St. Laurent scheme is to use this form of \f$\Gamma\f$:

\f[
   \Gamma = 0.2 \frac{N^2}{N^2 + \Omega^2}
\f]

instead of \f$\Gamma = 0.2\f$, where \f$\Omega\f$ is the angular velocity
of the Earth. This allows the buoyancy fluxes to tend to zero in regions
of very weak stratification, allowing a no-flux bottom boundary condition
to be satisfied.

\subsection subsection_polzin Polzin

The vertical diffusion profile of \cite polzin2009 is a WKB-stretched
algebraic decay profile. It is based on a radiation balance equation,
which links the dissipation profile associated with internal breaking to
the finescale internal wave shear producing that dissipation. The vertical
profile of internal-tide driven energy dissipation can then vary in time
and space, and evolve in a changing climate (\cite melet2012). \cite melet2012
describes how the Polzin scheme is implemented in MOM6,
copied here.

The parameterization of \cite polzin2009 links the energy dissipation
profile to the finescale internal wave shear producing that
dissipation, using an idealized vertical wavenumber energy spectrum
to identify analytic solutions to a radiation balance equation
(\cite polzin2004). These solutions yield a dissipation profile
\f$\epsilon(z)\f$:

\f[
   \epsilon = \frac{\epsilon_0}{[1 + (z/z_p)]^2},
\f]

where the magnitude \f$\epsilon_0\f$ and scale height \f$z_p\f$ can be expressed in terms of the
spectral amplitude and bandwidth of the idealized vertical wavenumber energy spectrum in uniform
stratification (\cite polzin2009).

To take into account the nonuniform stratification, \cite polzin2009 applied a buoyancy scaling
using the Wentzel-Kramers-Brillouin (WKB) approximation. As a result, the vertical wavenumber of a
wave packet varies in proportion to the buoyancy frequency \f$N\f$, which in turn implies an
additional transport of energy to smaller scales, and thus a possible enhanced mixing in regions of
strong stratification. Such effects can be described by buoyancy scaling the vertical coordinate
\f$z\f$ as

\f[
   z^{\ast}(z) = \int_{0}^{z} \left[ \frac{N^2 (z^\prime )}{N_b^2} \right] dz^{\prime} ,
\f]

with \f$z^\prime\f$ being positive upward relative to the bottom of the ocean. The turbulent
dissipation rate then becomes

\f[
   \epsilon = \frac{\epsilon_0}{[1 + (z^{\ast} /z_p)]^2} \frac{N^2(z)}{N_b^2} .
\f]

The spectral amplitude and bandwidth of the idealized vertical wavenumber
energy spectrum are identified after WKB scaling using a quasi-linear
spectral model of internal-tide generation that incorporates horizontal
advection of the barotropic tide into the momentum equation (\cite bell1975).
As a result, Polzin's formulation leads to an expression for
the spatially and temporally varying dissipation of internal tide energy
at the bottom \f$\epsilon_0\f$, and the vertical scale of decay for the
dissipation of internal tide energy \f$z_p\f$.

\subsubsection subsection_energy_conserving Energy-conserving form

To satisfy energy conservation (the integral of the vertical structure for the turbulent dissipation
over depth should be unity), the dissipation is rewritten as

\f[
   \epsilon = \frac{\epsilon_0 z_p}{1 + (z^\ast/z_p)]^2} \frac{N^2(z)}{N^2_b} \left[
   \frac{1}{z^{\ast(z=H)}} + \frac{1}{z_p} \right] .
\f]

In the MOM6 implementation, we use the \cite st_laurent2002 template for the vertical flux of energy
at the ocean floor, so that in both formulations:

\f[
   \int_{0}^{H} \epsilon (z) dz = \frac{qE}{\rho} .
\f]

Whereas \cite polzin2009 assumed that the total dissipation was locally in balance with the
barotropic to baroclinic energy conversion rate \f$(q=1)\f$, here we use the \cite simmons2004 value
of \f$q=1/3\f$ to retain as much consistency as possible between both parameterizations.

\subsubsection subsection_vertical_decay_scale Vertical decay-scale reformulation

We follow the \cite polzin2009 prescription for the vertical scale of
decay for the dissipation of internal-tide energy. However, we assume
that the topographic power law, denoted as \f$\nu\f$ in \cite polzin2009,
is equal to 1 (instead of 0.9) and we reformulated the expression of
\f$z_p\f$ to put it in a more readable form:

\f[
   z_p = \frac{z_p^\mbox{ref} (\kappa^\mbox{ref})^2 (h^\mbox{ref})^2 (N_b^\mbox{ref})^3} {U^\mbox{ref}}
   \frac{U}{h^2 \kappa^2 N_b^3} .
\f]

The superscript ref refers to reference values of the various parameters, as given by
observations from the Brazil basin. Therefore, the above can be rewritten as

\f[
   z_p = \mu (N_b^\mbox{ref} )^2
   \frac{U}{h^2 \kappa^2 N_b^3} .
\f]

where \f$\mu\f$ is a nondimensional constant \f$(\mu = 0.06970)\f$ and \f$N_b^\mbox{ref} = 9.6 \times
10^{-4} s^{-1}\f$. Finally, a minimum decay scale of \f$z_p = 100 m\f$ is imposed in our
implementation.

\subsubsection subsection_reformulation_WKB Reformulation of the WKB scaling

Since the dissipation is expressed as a function of the ratio \f$z^\ast / z_p\f$, a different WKB
scaling can be used so long as we modify \f$z_p\f$ accordingly. In the implemented parameterization,
we define the scaled height coordinate \f$z^\ast\f$ by

\f[
   z^\ast (z) = \frac{1}{\overline{N^2 (z)}^z} \int_{0}^{z} N^2(z^\prime ) dz ^\prime ,
\f]

with \f$z^\prime\f$ defined to be the height above the ocean bottom. By normalizing \f$N^2\f$ by its
vertical mean \f$\overline{N^2}^z\f$, \f$z^\ast\f$ ranges from \f$0\f$ to \f$H\f$, the depth of the
ocean.

The WKB-scaled vertical decay scale for the Polzin formulation becomes

\f[
   z^\ast_p = \mu(N_b^\mbox{ref})^2 \frac{U}{h^2 \kappa^2 N_b \overline{N^2}^z} .
\f]

Unlike the \cite st_laurent2002 parameterization, the vertical decay scale now depends on physical
variables and can evolve with a changing climate.

Finally, the Polzin vertical profile of dissipation implemented in the model is given by

   \epsilon = \frac{qE(x,y)}{\rho [1 + (z^\ast/z_p^\ast)]^2} \frac{N^2(z)}{\overline{N^2}^z}

In both parameterizations, turbulent diapycnal diffusivities are inferred from the dissipation
\f$\epsilon\f$ by:

\f[
   K_d = \frac{\Gamma \epsilon}{N^2}
\f]

and using this form of \f$\Gamma\f$:

\f[
   \Gamma = 0.2 \frac{N^2}{N^2 + \Omega^2}
\f]

instead of \f$\Gamma = 0.2\f$, where \f$\Omega\f$ is the angular velocity
of the Earth. This allows the buoyancy fluxes to tend to zero in regions
of very weak stratification, allowing a no-flux bottom boundary condition
to be satisfied.

\subsection subsection_Lee_waves Nikurashin Lee Wave Mixing

If one has the INT_TIDE_DISSIPATION flag on, there is an option to also turn on
LEE_WAVE_DISSIPATION. The theory is presented in \cite nikurashin2010a
while the application of it is presented in \cite nikurashin2010b. For
the implementation in MOM6, it is required that you provide an estimate
of the TKE loss due to the Lee waves which is then applied with either
the St. Laurent or the Polzin vertical profile.

\todo Is there a script to produce this somewhere or what???

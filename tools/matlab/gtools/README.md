gtools
======

Collection of matlab scripts to help visualize output from the GOLD and MOM6 ocean models.

For help within Matlab. List of tools:

    >> help gtools

For help on a particular tool:

    >> help gread

Installation
============
To intall in your Matlab path:

    % cd matlab
    % git clone https://github.com/Adcroft/gtools.git

Then add <code>addpath('~/matlab/gtools')</code> to your ~/matlab/startup.m

Support
=======

At this time we are unable to provide individual support. These tools are designed to work specifically with MOM6 and GOLD ocean model output. To the extent that we use these tools extensively in the development of those models, we expect the tools to be functional and robust. We will not necessarily ignore feedback and cries for help but nor can we simply promise a response.
